# 1. Decide Users In Protype Scope

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide upon which users we will showcase in the protyotype

## Considered Options

* Include all roles
* Include some roles
* Include one role

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Include some roles", because
* Including all roles will take too much time for a proof of concept
* Including the application can't function with only one role, even as a proof of concept

### Consquences
This will allow for us to create a small proof of concept to demonstrate the system to stakeholders
