# 4. Architectural Viewpoint

## Context and Problem Statement

A decision must be made on the architectural viewpoint and rules for the first two levels of C4

## Considered Options

* Use UMl notation
* Use basic C4 notation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use C4 notation", because
* Our domain modelling was done in UML, so using C4 can differentiate them
* C4 is more flexible which is helpful for the varying degrees of abstraction

### Consquences
We will be able to create architectural diagrams for the context and containers of our application
