# 1. Domain Model Decision

## Context and Problem Statement

Should the account and registration system be included in the domain model?

## Considered Options

* Include the account and registration in the domain model
* Only include account
* Include neither

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Include the account and registration in the domain model", because
* These are fundamental components of the system
* I don't belive we could show the login and registration without including these elements

### Consquences
Our domain model now effectively showcases the account login
